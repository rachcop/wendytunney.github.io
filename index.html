        <h3>Moving through LIFE can be fun!</h3>
        <img src="images/succulents.jpg" title="Photo of variety of succulents" alt="succulent plants">
        <p>At one time or another, most of us embarked on an effort to change some part of ourselves or our lives. We’ve decided to end a relationship, to start saving, to drop a few pounds or to get a new job. As a rule, these sorts of changes don’t occur overnight. They take time and effort and they tend to evolve through a “not ready” mindset to “taking small steps”.</p>
        <p>If your goal is to live a deeply fulfilling, joyous and inspired life, then let’s figure out together where the disconnect is between where you are and where you want to be. As your coach, we’ll explore options, discover what you really want in life, and focus on what you truly love to do.</p>
        <p>Your life is meant to be a dazzling expression of all that you are. It’s the difference between simply existing and truly living.</p>
